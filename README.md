#Show 10 most popular GitHub repositories from users in your city.
Example for Kyiv:
GitHub username is a link to their GitHub profile (should be opened in a new tab).
If the GitHub API returns an error (i.e. rate limit exceeded) - show a notification to the user.

#Implementation requirements
- React.js
- Redux
- Styled-components
- All work should be done in the public git repository of your choice (github, gitlab,
bitbucket, etc). When the task is completed, please share the repository URL. Commit
history is very important to understand the development flow.
- The React.js app should be live and running when you submit the completed task. You
can use free tiers of popular services like Heroku or something else that you prefer.
